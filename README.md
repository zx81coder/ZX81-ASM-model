# ZX81-ASM-model
Base model to compile ASM in shortest code on a ZX81

Yhis file is a base to make the shortest Z80-code on a ZX81
The file holds all necessary systemvariables and will auto start your machinecode.
The start in BASIC is cleverly placed over the systemvariables and the screen on a ZX81
will be set to it smallest form. For every not used line the ZX81 uses a LF but that can be replaced by a 
single JP (HL)
